# Car Sales Price Prediction using Linear, Logarithmic and Polynomial Regressions

## Description

This repository contains a project that uses linear, logarithmic and polynomial regressions to predict the sale price of Camaro brand cars for a used car agency. 31 data points of car sale prices were collected, taking into account variables such as age, mileage (in miles), condition (poor, average or excellent) and whether the car has had a single owner. Tools such as pandas, matplotlib and Scikit Learn in python were used.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed: pandas, matplotlib and Scikit Learn. You can then clone the repository and run Jupyter Notebook.
